# Community Governance & Token Utility

As a community-driven project, GM.Land aims to involve its users in the decision-making process. Landowners and Checks owners will have voting rights on various project proposals and developments, giving the community a say in the platform's direction.

As the platform evolves, GM.Land will explore additional use cases for the Checks token, such as in-game currency, rewards for community activities, and access to exclusive features.
