# Permissionless Referral System

## Referral Table

Anyone can become a referrer on GM.Land. Simply head to GM.Land and authenticate your Twitter login. Your Twitter handle is the referral code. Share your Twitter handle to your friends, family and network and they will receive a discount at mint. You will receive a commission. A Check is $8 at mint.

As you make more referrals, the discount goes up and your commission goes up.\

## Rewards for Top Communities

{% hint style="info" %}
**The referral system rewards are currently under review. In good faith, it is likely that the \~0.5M USDC worth of rewards cannot "just be given" and we might need to change the amount of rewards to a number that scales in proportion to the mint participation**
{% endhint %}

Any referrer can [designate up to 3 communities (NFT collections) that they vibe with.](social-media-features.md)

Post-mint, extra Checks will be minted for the following criteria. For the team size criteria we will only count referral code / wallet pairs with more than 1 referred sale.

It is intended that “normies” will be able to fully participate in this program through credit cards and email logins that support Ethereum.&#x20;

The top 10 communities by referral sales will receive a number of Checks that will allow them to mint an XL sized land (2,048 Checks).

The top 10 communities by the number of referrers with more than 1 referral sale will also receive the same. A single community will be able to win in both categories.&#x20;

This is a permissionless referral system meaning anyone is free to participate and designate any community they want, as long as the community has an NFT collection that can be verified.

Then it is up to the communities to embrace the award and claim it if it desires to do so.
