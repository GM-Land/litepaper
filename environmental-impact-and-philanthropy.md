# Environmental Impact & Philanthropy

GM.Land's commitment to planting trees is an integral part of the project's vision. The platform aims to maintain a positive environmental impact by regularly evaluating its carbon footprint, exploring additional ways to contribute to global reforestation efforts, and engaging in other philanthropic initiatives.

The community will be able to propose and vote to donate to a different cause downstream.
