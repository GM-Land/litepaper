# Revenue Distribution

{% hint style="info" %}
As the Tokenomics page has had a significant change as well as the minting model (with the introduction of Open Season Mint), this page is currently under review and is subject to major changes. We document all of our changes, therefore the thought-process in the name of high transparency.

## Survival Mode

Today is 27 March 2023 here in Melbourne, Australia. We have started with 100k AUD on the 10 Feb 2023. The balance is now 24,800 AUD which means the burn rate is roughly 49,985 AUD or 33,225 USD per month.

This number is higher than we'd like it to be but this should be the best indication of what building at the same velocity will cost in the future.

Since there's no guarantee the Season 1 mint revenue will be millions of dollars or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, we will need to position ourselves in a way where we do not rely on the mint revenue to deliver our platform - in fact, we have to be able to operate in what we call "Survival Mode" - like how a scrappy, bootstrapped startup would operate to ensure we make it to the next Season of mint.

**During Survival Mode, the Revenue Distribution charts below will not apply.** Also, donation for planting of trees will be deferred to a point in time where we can exit Survival Mode.

**GM.Land will exit Survival Mode once we have saved up 33,255 x 12 months = 399,060 USD equivalent, efficiently securing 12 months of runway.**

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: GM.Land's minting is not to be confused with a fundraiser process. We will, at all times, be sufficiently capitalised to build and ship the next iteration of the project with zero reliance on the mint proceeds.
{% endhint %}

## Normal Mode

Although these numbers can change, the 12.5% committed to planting trees should not as it indicates our promise to plant a tree for each Check sold at full price.

We publish the 3 pie charts for the sake of total transparency.
