# Tokenomics & Open Season Mint

Users can claim Land NFTs (ERC-721) by burning Checks (ERC-1155). Land NFTs come in different sizes, each requiring a different number of Checks.

Burning a single Check will allow the user to place themselves on the map and participate in the social ecosystem.

Burning multiple Checks on the other hand will apply a Multiplier to the outcome where the number of Checks you will receive will be multiplied. See the following example.

The "Area" in the below charts will equal the voting power of the Land token**.**

### 8x Multiplier

| Land | Width | Height | Area   | Checks Req. | Price @ Mint |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| XXS  | 1     | 1      | 1      | 1           | $8           |
| XS   | 8     | 8      | 64     | 8           | $64          |
| S    | 16    | 16     | 256    | 32          | $256         |
| M    | 32    | 32     | 1,024  | 128         | $1,024       |
| L    | 64    | 64     | 4,096  | 512         | $4,096       |
| XL   | 128   | 128    | 16,384 | 2,048       | $16,384      |

## Open Season Minting

Open Editions have been the latest craze in early 2023 with Jack Butcher hitting a homerun with his Checks VV Edition collection.&#x20;

Open Editions generally have a short minting period where the supply is unlimited and the supply is only limited by the time limit that is imposed.

As GM.Land is primarily a social ecosystem, our goals are to be accessible to everyone and also to onboard as many as possible to web3.

To incentivise early adopters, it is the founders' intention that Season 1 of minting will offer a 16x multiplier and Season 2 will likely see a lower multiplier like 8x.

### 16x Multiplier

| Land | Width | Height | Area   | Checks Req. | Price @ Mint |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| XXS  | 1     | 1      | 1      | 1           | $8           |
| XS   | 8     | 8      | 64     | 4           | $32          |
| S    | 16    | 16     | 256    | 16          | $128         |
| M    | 32    | 32     | 1,024  | 64          | $512         |
| L    | 64    | 64     | 4,096  | 256         | $2,048       |
| XL   | 128   | 128    | 16,384 | 1,024       | $8,192       |

At the time of writing, it is the founders' intention to make the Checks supply inflationary - perhaps a sensible figure to the tune of 5% per annum to be minted for the Community Treasury to allow onboarding of more users to the GM.Land ecosystem in the future and to nurture and incentivise activities that are great for the community-driven ecosystem.

| Land | 16X    | 8X      | 4X      | 2X      | 1X       |
| ---- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| XS   | $32    | $64     | $128    | $256    | $512     |
| S    | $128   | $256    | $512    | $1,024  | $2,048   |
| M    | $512   | $1,024  | $2,048  | $4,096  | $8,192   |
| L    | $2,048 | $4,096  | $8,192  | $16,384 | $32,768  |
| XL   | $8,192 | $16,384 | $32,768 | $65,536 | $131,072 |

## **When does minting stop?**

The founders currently believe that minting should at least go for 5 Seasons, with each minting season bringing in a fresh batch of users to the GM.Land ecosystem.

Important questions like whether there is a Season 6 and beyond or how long the minting period of Season 5 lasts is a decision likely best deferred to a Community vote.

| Season   | Multiplier |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Season 1 | 16X        |
| Season 2 | 8X         |
| Season 3 | 4X         |
| Season 4 | 2X         |
| Season 5 | 1X         |
