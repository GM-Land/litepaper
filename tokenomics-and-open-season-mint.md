# Tokenomics & Open Season Mint

Users can claim Land NFTs (ERC-721) by burning Checks (ERC-1155). Land NFTs come in different sizes, each requiring a different number of Checks.

Burning a single Check will allow the user to place themselves on the map and participate in the social ecosystem.

Burning multiple Checks on the other hand will apply a Multiplier to the outcome where the number of Checks you will receive will be multiplied. See the following example.

## Open Season Minting

Open Editions have been the latest craze in early 2023 with Jack Butcher hitting a home-run with his Checks VV Edition collection.&#x20;

Open Editions generally have a short minting period where the supply is unlimited and the supply is only limited by the time limit that is imposed.

As GM.Land is primarily a social ecosystem, our goals are to be accessible to everyone and also to onboard as many as possible to web3.

To incentivise early adopters, it is the founders' intention that Season 1 of minting will offer a 16x multiplier and Season 2 will likely see a lower multiplier like 8x.

The "Area" in the below charts will equal the voting power of the Land token**.**

### Multiplier - more land for same price

<table><thead><tr><th width="91">Land</th><th width="102">Checks </th><th width="63">X</th><th width="113">Area</th><th width="84">Width</th><th width="92">Height</th><th>Price @ Mint</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>XS</td><td>4</td><td>16</td><td>64</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>$32</td></tr><tr><td>S</td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>256</td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>$128</td></tr><tr><td>M</td><td>64</td><td>16</td><td>1,024</td><td>32</td><td>32</td><td>$512</td></tr><tr><td>L</td><td>256</td><td>16</td><td>4,096</td><td>64</td><td>64</td><td>$2,048</td></tr><tr><td>XL</td><td>1,024</td><td>16</td><td>16,384</td><td>128</td><td>128</td><td>$8,192</td></tr></tbody></table>

**The multiplier (X above) is applied when burning and converting multiple Checks to Land. As per the above chart, for the XL sized land, although the land actually contains 16,384 Checks, the required number of Checks is only 1,024 since a 16x multiplier is applied. The multiplier essentially is an early-adopter discount.**

**A Check is an NFT but also the smallest unit in GM.Land and therefore the terms "Check" and "pixel" are used interchangeably. No multipliers will apply to a single Check as illustrated above.**

Below you can see how the number of Checks required and the price changes when the multiplier is reduced.

<table><thead><tr><th width="91">Land</th><th width="102">Checks </th><th width="63">X</th><th width="113">Area</th><th width="84">Width</th><th width="92">Height</th><th>Price @ Mint</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>XS</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>64</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>$64</td></tr><tr><td>S</td><td>32</td><td>8</td><td>256</td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>$256</td></tr><tr><td>M</td><td>128</td><td>8</td><td>1,024</td><td>32</td><td>32</td><td>$1,024</td></tr><tr><td>L</td><td>512</td><td>8</td><td>4,096</td><td>64</td><td>64</td><td>$4,096</td></tr><tr><td>XL</td><td>2,048</td><td>8</td><td>16,384</td><td>128</td><td>128</td><td>$16,384</td></tr></tbody></table>

At the time of writing, it is the founders' intention to make the Checks supply inflationary - perhaps a sensible figure to the tune of 5% per annum to be minted for the Community Treasury to allow onboarding of more users to the GM.Land ecosystem in the future and to nurture and incentivise activities that are great for the community-driven ecosystem.

| Checks | 16x   | 8x    | 4x    | 2x    | 1x     |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| XS     | 4     | 8     | 16    | 32    | 64     |
| S      | 16    | 32    | 64    | 128   | 256    |
| M      | 64    | 128   | 256   | 512   | 1,024  |
| L      | 256   | 512   | 1,024 | 2,048 | 4,096  |
| XL     | 1,024 | 2,048 | 4,096 | 8,192 | 16,384 |

| Price | 16x    | 8x      | 4x      | 2x      | 1x       |
| ----- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| XS    | $32    | $64     | $128    | $256    | $512     |
| S     | $128   | $256    | $512    | $1,024  | $2,048   |
| M     | $512   | $1,024  | $2,048  | $4,096  | $8,192   |
| L     | $2,048 | $4,096  | $8,192  | $16,384 | $32,768  |
| XL    | $8,192 | $16,384 | $32,768 | $65,536 | $131,072 |

The 1x column above should be considered the normal price for Land. Multipliers provide heavy discounts for being early as getting to a critical mass of early users and thereby forming a close-knit community is pivotal to the success of GM.Land.

## **When does minting stop?**

The founders currently believe that minting should at least go for 5 Seasons, with each minting season bringing in a fresh batch of users to the GM.Land ecosystem.

Important questions like whether there is a Season 6 and beyond or how long the minting period of Season 5 lasts is a decision likely best deferred to a Community vote.

| Season   | Multiplier |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Season 1 | 16x        |
| Season 2 | 8x         |
| Season 3 | 4x         |
| Season 4 | 2x         |
| Season 5 | 1x         |
