**GM.Land is a decentralising social ecosystem built on top of virtual land.**

{% hint style="info" %}
**This litepaper is a living document and is subject to major changes in a matter of days or even hours. We therefore document our though process in a** [**version tracked system**](https://github.com/GM-Land/litepaper/) **in the name of high transparency.**
{% endhint %}

We say _decentralising_ üòÅ since, we admit, we will not be fully decentralised at the start - eg. the team, the technical infrastructure and project governance, will continue to develop over time. But hear us out as we reveal our plans to fully decentralise in this litepaper.

GM.Land is community-driven NFT project that enables users to own and customise virtual land on a pixel map, represented as unique Land NFTs.&#x20;

Each land plot will also link back to a land owners detailed profile which will include links to their social platforms, digital holdings and other various elements unique to that land owner. This profile will also serve as a communication platform where users can post and message.

The pixel map serves as a web3 billboard (above), allowing user to upload images or logos to their land, effectively creating a personalised advertising space. Additionally, when a user's land is selected, a personal social media profile launches where users can elect to to detail their third party social media outlets, digital asset holdings, galleries and other customisable options such as avatars and custom rooms/spaces.

The project incorporates a community treasury, tokens called Checks (ERC-1155) and unique Land tokens (ERC-721). Users can burn multiple Checks to claim Land NFTs with varying sizes and unique X, Y coordinates. Both tokens are treated as governance tokens with voting power.

GM.Land is committed to building and maintaining a social license to operate. It will continue to develop initiatives that support a sustainable future environmentally and humanitarianism.

It is intended, at the time of writing that GM.Land will be deployed on Polygon which claims to be a carbon-neutral blockchain.
