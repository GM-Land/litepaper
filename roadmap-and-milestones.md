# Roadmap & Milestones

The founders of GM.Land envision a future where the platform transitions from a centralised team to a decentralised team comprised of community members. This "exit to a DAO" strategy ensures that the platform remains community-driven, with key decisions made by those who actively participate in its growth.

One core goal for GM.Land is to ship at least one new feature per month that benefits the community and improves the platform. By consistently introducing new features, GM.Land aims to stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving NFT and metaverse landscape.

Some suggestions for community discussion as far as roadmap is concerned:

* Implementing a Twitter clone (readily available on GitHub)
* Fully decentralising the infrastructure (at the time of launch there will be AWS and other centralised dependencies, unfortunately)
* Improving the social media features
* Multi-chain Support
* Exploring and investing heavily in brand partnerships and collaborations

As part of the platform's roadmap, GM.Land will prioritise community involvement and governance. Key milestones include developing the social media space, incorporating guest books, posts, and likes, and facilitating the handover to a decentralised team through the "exit to a DAO" strategy.

By combining innovative technology, community governance, environmental responsibility, and a commitment to continuous improvement, GM.Land aims to create a lasting impact in the world of virtual land ownership and the metaverse.
